#### *Beyond academics, I'm proud of my time at McGill because I was heavily involved in extra-curricular projects.*

## Project Manager At McGill Robotics

As Project Manager of McGill Robotics, I coordinated the growth of the design team from 2 returning members to a team of 98 committed students that competes in multiple competitions against universities from around the world. Coining our motto, *Team Before Machine*, I have prioritized the long-term development of a cohesive team with effective mechanisms for learning new skills as we work together to build robots.

## Autonomous Underwater Vehicle

As leader of the 60-person engineering team, my responsibility was to coordinate the Software, Mechanical, Electrical, and Systems divisions such that a fully autonomous underwater vehicle could be designed, built, and tested to be robust enough to compete internationally, all within less than a year. I also took on a technical role, developing the propulsion and control system for the vehicle using C++ and ROS.

## McGill LunarEx Robotics

In my first year at Project Manager, we built a lunar mining robot for the NASA Lunabotics Mining Competition. After a year of hard work from the 40 committed team members, we were awarded 12th place out of 50 teams from around the world.

## Braille University

As a part of a term project in Human Computer Interaction, I worked on a team of three students to build an iOS app to help teach braille to visually impaired users.
