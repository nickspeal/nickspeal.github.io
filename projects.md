#### McGill Robotics



As Project Manager of McGill Robotics, I led the team through its growth from 2 returning members to 98 committed students that competes in multiple competitions against universities from around the world. Coining our motto, *Team Before Machine*, I have prioritized the long-term development of a cohesive team with a focus on learning new skills as we work together to build robots.
