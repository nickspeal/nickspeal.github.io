    <h1>Engineering Portfolio for DarkVision</h1>
    <div class="article-wrap">
      <p>I would be very excited to work for DarkVision: a growing company building a product with enormous potential. The startup atmosphere is a very motivating and the product lies right at the intersection of my interests and background: the integration of mechanical, electrical, and software systems. </p>

<p>It is difficult to prepare a portfolio because a lot my work doesn’t lend itself to presentation in this format. On this page, I have included links to my work where possible and provided brief descriptions otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>I am a fresh engineering graduate that brings enthusiasm and a broad array of skills to the table: perfectly suited for the evolving needs of a startup building a brand new product. My expertise is in Mechanical Engineering, combining a strong academic background with hands-on experience. I hope that my application stands out from other Mechanical Engineering graduates because of my experience building systems from the ground up and completing 4 major software projects. </p>

<p>My references will attest to my hardworking and enthusiastic attitude that is contagious in a team environment. My accomplishments demonstrate that I am self-motivated and I make sure that I get things done.</p>

<h2 id="a-mechanical-engineer">A Mechanical Engineer</h2>

<h4 id="academic-foundation">Academic Foundation</h4>

<p>My technical competencies are built upon a foundation in Mechanical Engineering. McGill has a rigorous 5-year engineering program that taught me fundamentals of structural analysis, especially Statics &amp; Dynamics and Rigid &amp; Deformable Solid Mechanics. With a GPA of 3.9/4.0, I graduated in the top 5% of my class. A full transcript is available <a href="/files/Nick_Speal_Unofficial_Transcript.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="hands-on-experience">Hands-On Experience</h4>

<p>Beyond Academics, I feel that I have learned at least as much through practical hands-on experience.</p>

<p>I have logged approximately 150 hours in the machine shop, primarily on the vertical mill and lathe. I have gotten quick at churning out simple parts, but our waterproof seals and bearing fits required extra care and patient metrology to achieve dimensions within .002”. </p>

<p>I delegated the creation of our machine drawings, but often reviewed them to maintain high standards for clarity and organization. An example drawing can be found <a href="/files/PV-BATTERY-ENDCAP_FRONT.pdf">here</a>. This drawing was made by my teammate and I machined the part.</p>

<p>We also needed a number of parts to be manufactured on a 3- or 5-axis CNC mill, so I worked with my teammates to outsource small batches to local machine shops and negotiated pricing and lead times. </p>

<p>Having worked on the assembly of two major robots, several “weekend-project” robots, and test-rigs in research labs, I’ve developed an intuitive and tactile sense of how different materials behave: from aluminum and steel to composites to numerous plastics. A video of some teammates and I laying up fiberglass over a polystyrene mold can be found <a href="https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=529565973741446&amp;permPage=1">here</a>.</p>

<p>An appreciation for how things are made is essential for mechanical design.</p>

</div>

<p><em>This is a CAD render of the Lunar Excavator we designed and built for the NASA Lunabotics Mining Competition.</em></p>

<h2 id="a-broad-background">A Broad Background</h2>

<p>I have also taken every opportunity to expand my knowledge beyond the limits of pure mechanical engineering, through technical work that I have done myself and closely supervising and collaborating with engineering students from several disciplines. </p>

<h4 id="programming">Programming</h4>

<p>Most recently, I built the control system for our autonomous underwater vehicle with C++ and ROS. While our McGill Robotics competition repository is private, I have hosted the important files for the controls package on my <a href="https://github.com/nickspeal/McGill-Robotics-AUV-Control-System/tree/master/controls/src">personal github account</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>I also built a Graphical User Interface in Python. This application made it easy for users to enter over 100 parameters, run turbomachinery simulations, and plot the results. However, I am not allowed to share the intellectual property from this project.</p>

<p>The next summer, I worked in the Shockwave Physics Lab at McGill. Here, I developed a simulator in MATLAB to model the physical interactions of granular particles.</p>

<p>As a part of a term project in Human Computer Interaction, I worked on a team of three students to build an iOS app to help teach braille to visually impaired users. Since then, I have been hired part-time by the University of Montreal’s School of Optometry, and I am working on finalizing the application to publish on the app store.</p>

<p>I have also built smaller programs, such as a <a href="https://github.com/nickspeal/MECH-513-Control-Systems-Assignment/blob/master/MECH%20513%20Assignment%204.pdf?raw=true">class project in Control Systems</a>, an <a href="https://github.com/nickspeal/ROStools/blob/master/bag2csv.py">open-source data processing tool</a> for the ROS robotics community, and a <a href="https://github.com/nickspeal/Prison-Light-Riddle">fun simulation of a riddle</a> that a friend once asked me.</p>

<h4 id="system-design">System Design</h4>

<p>As the Project Manager for McGill Robotics, I worked with my teammates for two years on all aspects of electro-mechanical system design. This doesn’t leave me with individual accomplishments that I can showcase, but rather a broad introduction to many commonly used technologies. Some of these are listed below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Motor selection - [<a href="/images/lunarex/motors.jpg">Photo</a>]</li>
  <li>Wheel tread design - [<a href="http://liphe.mcgill.ca/lunarex.html">More Info</a>]</li>
  <li>Suspension and dumping linkage design - [<a href="/images/lunarex/robotBack.jpg">Photo 1</a>] [<a href="/images/lunarex/suspension.jpg">Photo 2</a>] [<a href="/images/lunarex/dumping.jpg">Photo 3</a>]</li>
  <li>Waterproofing - [<a href="/images/pv.jpg">Photo</a>]</li>
  <li>PCB design - [<a href="/images/pcb2.jpg">Photo</a>]</li>
  <li>Electrical component pacement &amp; wiring standards in tight spacing - [<a href="/images/pcb3.jpg">Photo</a>]</li>
  <li>2nd-hand thruster repair - [<a href="/images/rotor.jpg">Photo</a>]</li>
  <li>Robotic software systems integration - [<a href="/images/McGillRobotics/ROS_Graph.png">Photo</a>]</li>
</ul>

<p>Our collective work was recognized with Third Place in design (out of 39 international teams) at the RoboSub competition. This was primarily judged based on the final paper and presentation that I wrote and delivered with the team’s 3 division leaders. The paper can be found <a href="/files/McGillRoboticsFinalPaper.pdf">here</a>. </p>

<h2 id="work-experience">Work Experience</h2>

<p>Leading a large student team felt a lot like starting a company. I learned about the subtler aspects of what makes a business run. First and foremost, I’ve come to understand the importance of team dynamics, championing the phrase <em>Team Before Machine</em>. Graphite Publications published an article on my philosophy <a href="http://graphitepublications.com/team-building-with-mcgill-robotics/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I also know the role that the business side of the company plays in a successful engineering firm. Marketing, fundraising, and accounting can make a big difference, and my efforts to build a strong business team within McGill Robotics helped us recruit so many talented students, raise enough money to build our robots and fund travel to the competition, and earn us recognition in the larger McGill community. I spearheaded the sponsorship effort to raise $90,000 of cash and in-kind donations over 2 years. At the RoboSub competition, we earned 1st place for Best Branding and Business Development.</p>

<p>As a junior engineer, I don’t expect to be managing teams in the way that I did at McGill Robotics, but looking at the organizational dynamics from this perspective made me a better team player. I have also demonstrated that I am self-motivated and can work independently to get things done without too much oversight.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I am an enthusiastic mechanical engineering grad that would make a great addition to your team. As a young engineer, I have a lot of learning to do but I hope that my academic accomplishments demonstrate potential and my project experience gives me the skills to hit the ground running at DarkVision.</p>
