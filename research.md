#### *I have been actively involved in research at McGill for three years.*

## Aerospace Mechatronics Laboratory
*2013-2014*

Under the supervision of Prof Inna Sharf and Prof Meyer Nahon, I studied the thruster performance on the X8 unmanned aerial vehicle. [This work](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICUAS.2014.6842370) was published in the proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems. I also worked with other students on the LiDAR and other sensors to achieve autonomous take-off and landing of the vehicle in unstructured environments.

## Shockwave Physics Group
*2012*

Under the supervision of Prof Andrew Higgins, I carried out experiments in the detonation chamber and developed a granular dynamics physics simulator using MATLAB.

## Structural Dynamics and Vibration Laboratory
*2011*

Under the supervision of Prof Christophe Pierre and Dr. Alain Batailly, I built a front-end application in Python for airplane turbomachinery simulations.
