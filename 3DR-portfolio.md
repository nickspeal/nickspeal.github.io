I am very excited to work at 3D Robotics, North America's leading producer of unmanned aerial vehicles. My interdisciplinary background and software experience will help me learn quickly and grow with the company as we develop increasingly sophisticated autopilot performance for recreational and commercial applications.

While my coding experience is just one part of what makes me a great canditade for 3DR, the focus of this page is to showcase the most relevant software projects that I have worked on.


## More than just a programmer

* [Team Building with McGill Robotics](http://graphitepublications.com/team-building-with-mcgill-robotics/), by Graphite Publications
* [Development of the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle: Asimov](/files/McGillRoboticsFinalPaper.pdf), by Nick Speal et al.


My background as the Project Manager of McGill Robotics has given me an in-depth overview of team dynamics and mechatronics systems. Graphite Publications has written [an article](http://graphitepublications.com/team-building-with-mcgill-robotics/) about our team and my vision for a people-first approach to growth and success.

Attention to detail has helped me write excellent technical reports. [The final design report](/files/McGillRoboticsFinalPaper.pdf) that I wrote with 3 of my teammates was awarded 3rd place out of 39 entries at the AUVSI and ONR's 17th International Robosub Competition.



## Control System for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle

* [Source Code](https://github.com/nickspeal/McGill-Robotics-AUV-Control-System/tree/master/controls/src)

In addition to my leadership role, I also was a software developer for McGill Robotics. I built the control system for our autonomous underwater vehicle with C++ and ROS.

While our McGill Robotics competition repository is private, I have hosted the important files for the controls package on my [personal github account](https://github.com/nickspeal/McGill-Robotics-AUV-Control-System/tree/master/controls/src).

## MECH 513 - Control Systems Assignment

* [Assignment Submission](https://github.com/nickspeal/MECH-513-Control-Systems-Assignment/blob/master/MECH%20513%20Assignment%204.pdf)

Throughout my degree Mechanical Engineering, I often wrote short programs to analyze the various problems at hand. I have grown particularly familiar with MATLAB. 

Given the important role of control systems in 3D Robotics' stack, I have decided to include an excerpt from one assignment submission from my MECH 513 class. The assignment and my solutions can be found on [github](https://github.com/nickspeal/MECH-513-Control-Systems-Assignment/blob/master/MECH%20513%20Assignment%204.pdf).

## Python Scripts

* [bag2csv.py](https://github.com/nickspeal/ROStools)
* [prisonLight.py](https://github.com/nickspeal/Prison-Light-Riddle)

I have written several short python scripts for fun and for work, and hosted two of them on my GitHub account. The first is a tool for extracting numerical data from a rosbag log file and saving it in csv format for postprocessing. It can be found [here](https://github.com/nickspeal/ROStools).

The second script simulates a scenario described in a riddle about 100 prisoners who can only communicate by turning a lightbulb on and off. It can be found [here](https://github.com/nickspeal/Prison-Light-Riddle).






## Additional Software Projects

I have worked on a number of other major software projects in recent years. The first was a Graphical User Interface in Python. This application made it easy for users to enter over 100 parameters, run turbomachinery simulations, and visualize the results. However, I am not allowed to share the intellectual property from this project.

The next summer, I worked in the Shockwave Physics Lab at McGill. Here, I developed a simulator in MATLAB to model the physical interactions of granular particles. 

As a part of a term project in Human Computer Interaction, I worked on a team of three students to build an iOS app to help teach braille to visually impaired users. Since then, I have been hired part-time by the University of Montreal's School of Optometry, and I am working on finalizing the application to publish on the app store.

Every professor that I have worked with on these projects has been very satisfied with my work, and has told me they would be happy to be a reference for future employers.
