I was born in New York City and grew up in Toronto, where I became passionate about music and alpine ski racing. Then I moved to Montreal to study Mechanical Engineering at McGill Unversity. I was involved in research labs for three years, and led a design team called McGill Robotics. I built my bike in the community bike shop, and loved riding it all around town to explore.

After graduating, I went on a big road trip around North America: From Montreal to San Diego, around California and all the way up to Vancouver, BC and back. 

I followed my dreams to Sillicon Valley, where I'm building Unmanned Aerial Vehicles with [3D Robotics](http://www.3drobotics.com).

Always curious to question the way things are, I spend a lot of my time with friends debating points of view or speculating about the future of technology.
