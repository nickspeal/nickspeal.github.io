Born in New York City, I grew up in Toronto before moving to Montreal to complete a Mechanical Engineering Degree at McGill University. When I'm in the city, I ride my bike everywhere, but I try to get out skiing (on water or on snow!) whenever I can.

Always curious to question the way things are, I spend a lot of my time with friends debating points of view or speculating about the future of technology.
