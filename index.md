I'm a software engineer with a background in full-stack web development and robotics. I'm currently taking three months to study the ways in which educational software can augment traditional classrooms, especially for children who have been under-served by a system that all too often perpetuates economic inequality.

Whether working as a project manager or an individual contributor, I set an example of excellence by persevering through challenges, reconciling evolving priorities, and erring on the side of abundant (but organized!) communication.

Check out my [projects](/projects) page to learn about robots I've built for the moon, underwater, and mass production around the world.
