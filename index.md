I am a technology enthusiast with an engineering background in robotics. At McGill University, I was the Project Manager of McGill Robotics, a student design team that built a lunar rover and an autonomous underwater vehicle for international competitions. Over the course of three years of research at McGill, I've studied unmanned aerial vehicles and shockwave physics, and I built a graphical user interface for turbomachinery simulations.

After an amazing roadtrip around North America, I've settled in the San Francisco Bay Area, where I'm working as an Engineering Project Manager at [3D Robotics](http://www.3drobotics.com). At 3DR, we're helping people see their world from above!
