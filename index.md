I was born in New York City and earned a Mechanical Engineering degree at McGill University in Montreal. As the Project Manager for McGill Robotics, I led the team in its most successful year ever at the NASA Lunabotics Mining Competition and oversaw its growth to 98 students competing in multiple competitions against universities from around the world.

I am looking for a full-time position in the high-tech industry where I can work with peers across disciplines to solve challenging technical problems.
