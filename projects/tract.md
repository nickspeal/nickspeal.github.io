Tract is a project that I built at a Startup Weekend hackathon, which helps people track their habits so they can act to slow climate change. The main functionality that was built so far is focused around tracking patterns in how you use your car. I hope to drive my car less next year than I did last year, but that's a hard goal to meet without looking at the data!
