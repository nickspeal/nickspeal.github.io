In my first year as Project Manager, we built a lunar mining robot for the NASA Lunabotics Mining Competition. After a year of hard work from the 40 committed team members, we were awarded 12th place out of 50 teams from around the world.

The project page is sadly no-longer live, but you can see a snapshot of it [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160915060708/http://lunarex.mcgill.ca#)
