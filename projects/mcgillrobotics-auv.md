In my first year as Project Manager, we built a lunar mining robot for the NASA Lunabotics Mining Competition. After a year of hard work from the 40 committed team members, we were awarded 12th place out of 50 teams from around the world.

The project page is sadly no-longer live, but you can see a snapshot of it [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160915060708/http://lunarex.mcgill.ca#)


## Autonomous Underwater Vehicle

As leader of the 60-person engineering team, my responsibility was to supervise the Software, Mechanical, Electrical, and Systems divisions such that a fully autonomous underwater vehicle could be designed, built, and tested to be robust enough to compete internationally, all within less than a year. I also took on a technical role, developing the propulsion and control system for the vehicle using C++ and ROS.
