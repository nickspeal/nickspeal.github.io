I am excited to be starting a new job in the new year! I'll be an Engineering Project Manager at [3D Robotics](http://www.3drobotics.com), in Berkeley, California.

3D Robotics is a startup that was founded in 2009 and makes Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, or drones, for photography. The mission is to help people see their world from above. So far, the company has been very successful selling components to hobbyists, and is currently redesigning the user experience to make complete ready-to-fly autonomous systems more accessible to everyday consumers.

Drones open up a new dimension and perspective for photography, and we are all going to start seeing more beautiful photos and videos from above as the technology grows in popularity. 3DR's Instagram is fantastic, in my opinion, and definitely worth following to get a sense of how these vehicles can be used. Action sports enthusiasts have been early adopters, attaching their GoPro cameras to drones to capture shots from above. In fact, official GoPro promotional videos predominantly feature aerial shots, indicating how compelling this point of view can be.

There are also many ways that commercial operations such as agriculture and construction can use drones to gather information to save money, so this market is expected to expand as the legal framework emerges. 3D Robotics explicitly makes its products for non-military purposes.

I'll be one of approximately 30 employees in the Berkeley office; the company also has locations in San Diego, Austin, and Tijuana. We're working on an exciting new product and my mission as Engineering Project Manager is to make things go faster. I'm not a manager in the sense that I'm anybody's boss, but instead I will be diagnosing problems as they come up, running tests as necessary, and working with the other engineers to decide on the appropriate course of action. 

I'm thrilled with this job description as it combines some of the main aspects of what I've loved about McGill Robotics: teamwork, problem solving, product development, interdisciplinary learning, and creativity. I love how I'll be working with people every day while still being fully immersed in technical engineering challenges. I can't wait to get started!

I've taken the time to think carefully about what exactly I wanted and then looked around a lot for the perfect job. I'm incredibly grateful to everyone who has taken the time to help me figure this out. Trusted friends, family, and mentors have supported me with reassuring advice and valuable suggestions. Busy strangers have generously opened their doors to me with meaningful insight from different perspectives. If you're reading this blog post, you probably helped me out in my open-ended search for what's next. I can't express my appreciation deeply enough. Thank you! Let's please stay in touch!
